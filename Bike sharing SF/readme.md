# Bike Sharing Data Exploration 

## Dataset

This document explores a dataset containing information for 3036496 rides 
of a bike sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area. The daataset can 
be found here: https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data.



## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there are some clear patterns in bike utilization.
They are used by two types of clients: subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers
seem to have a more consistent and regular utilization of the bikes. Probably they 
use it for commuting. Some of the non subscribers are most likely tourists or people
who use these bikes for one-off situations. Non subscribers tend to enjoy more 
relaxed rides as they travel similar distances to subscribers, but take longer to do
them. Peak hours for bike utilization (for both type users) are between 7am and 9am 
and between 4pm and 9pm. January, February and March are the "busiest" months. 



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on understanding the distribution of the duration and distance of the rides, making adjustments in the data
and plots where necessary.

Then I focuse on finding patterns in terms of duration and distance, by user type.

Finally, I analyse the relationship between Months/Hour(start time of the ride)/Day of the week and duration/distance of the ride. I then 
also combine this with user type.
